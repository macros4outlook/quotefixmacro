The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

* We changed the default configuration to be more user convenient:
  * Outlook does not need to be configured to convert emails: `DEFAULT_CONVERT_TO_PLAIN` is `True` (instead of `False`)
  * QuoteFixMacro does not require to reconfigure the signatures any more: `DEFAULT_USE_QUOTING_TEMPLATE` is `True` (instead of `False`)
  * The newly opened window is made as wide as required to display the wrapping as it will be when the email is being sent: `DEFAULT_USE_SOFTWRAP` is `True` (instead of `False`)

## Version [1.9] - 2022-03-08

### Added

* Added `ThisOutlookSession.cls` for directly intercepting the standard reply buttons. [[#11](https://github.com/macros4outlook/quotefixmacro/pull/11)]
* In case the email target ends with a number, the reversal of names also works. I.e., in the case of `Lastname Firstname <firstname.lastname3@example.org>` "Firstname" is used as firstname.
* Include "Dr." in the name if that is present

### Fixed

* Empty line is kept after the header for forwarded mails [[#12](https://github.com/macros4outlook/quotefixmacro/pull/12)]
* Single-line emails keep the quoting character in the created reply email

## Version [1.8] - 2021-02-06

### Added

* In case departments are added at the end of a name, it is removed (e.g., `Firstname Lastname DEP DEP2` becomes `Firstname Lastname`)
* In case the sender format is `Lastname Firstname <firstname.lastname@example.org>`, it is assumed that the typing of the email (firstname before lastname) is correct.

### Changed

* Now recognizes `Lastname Firstname` as sender name format, too.
* Internationalization: Add `FixedReplyAllEnglish()` with a separate template for replies in English.
* In case a sender name takes something in braces at the end, that text is removed (e.g., "Test Name (42)" is converted to "Test Name")

### Fixed

### Added
